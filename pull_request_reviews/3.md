PR Review: Node version pinning and engine-strict

Summary
- This PR adds .nvmrc, .npmrc (engine-strict=true) and package.json engines to require Node 20. Good step for consistent dev environments.

Recommendations
1) Consider removing or documenting engine-strict=true
   - engine-strict=true will make npm installs fail for contributors not running Node 20. If you want strict enforcement, document it in README/CONTRIBUTING and ensure CI runs Node 20. Otherwise consider removing this or enforcing via CI.

2) Make engines semver explicit
   - Prefer: "node": ">=20.0.0 <21.0.0" for clearer semver semantics.

3) Clarify .nvmrc value
   - "20" pins the major. Consider a patch (e.g., 20.14.0) for reproducibility or "lts/*" to track the LTS line. Add a short README blurb about using nvm/Volta/asdf.

4) Update CI to run Node 20
   - Ensure GitHub Actions / CI uses Node 20 so builds/tests match local dev.

Optional
- Add Volta/asdf config for easier onboarding.

Small edits I can prepare:
- Update package.json engines to "node": ">=20.0.0 <21.0.0".
- Add README note about Node 20 and nvm usage.

Would you like me to prepare a follow-up PR with these small edits? If so I can create a branch and open a PR.
